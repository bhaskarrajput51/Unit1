Hello Masai

This is Bhaskar Kumar(fw23_0257) I'm a bio student from the begining and had never thought that i could be interested in coding , after completing my B.Sc. in 
Agriculture i was unable to get a job in which i could get a growth, then after one of my friend (IItian) suggested me to get in the line of coding for that 
I don't need to be from a technical background , then I started to research about it on Youtube and Google there i found that it's really amazing and 
career building thing as well. So now the question was from where I can get a platform many people suggested me for different coding classes but There I found 
an only class about which there was no negative reviews and the fact was that they will take money once u get a job of 5lpa because they want u to pay fee by your money 
not by your parents that was so amazing . I started class by registering there and now I'm a masaian and so glad because the way the teachers Experience champion 
Shweta ma'am , Pulkit sir , Bikky Dutta sir and tanya ma'am teaches us and treat us I haven't seen these in any online teaching platforms till now . 
in last there are  only words to say - i'M FEELING LUCKY TO BE A MASAIAN.
